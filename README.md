## Instructions

This is a web implementation of the classic memory matching game concentration. To play, simply load in your browser and start clicking cards to flip.

If two cards match, they will stay flipped. Match all the cards to win the game!

A timer is started when you click your first card. There is also a star rating that is dependant on the number of moves it takes for you to complete the game. The less moves the better!
